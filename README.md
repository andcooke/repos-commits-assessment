  ## Future Improvements
  
  It was important to submit as soon as I could, but if I had another day I would have liked to implement the following improvements:
    *  caching searches for faster load times.
    *  more on-screen feedback for better UX.
    *  pagination for repos and commits for faster load times and better UX.
